The collections module provides powerful and flexible data structures that can simplify and optimize your code:

namedtuple: For creating simple classes.
deque: For fast and flexible queues and stacks.
Counter: For counting elements.
OrderedDict: For dictionaries that remember insertion order.
defaultdict: For dictionaries with default values.
ChainMap: For combining multiple mappings.

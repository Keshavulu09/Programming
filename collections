The collections module provides powerful and flexible data structures that can simplify and optimize your code:

namedtuple: For creating simple classes.
deque: For fast and flexible queues and stacks.
Counter: For counting elements.
OrderedDict: For dictionaries that remember insertion order.
defaultdict: For dictionaries with default values.
ChainMap: For combining multiple mappings.


Key Classes in queue Module
Queue: This is a FIFO (first in, first out) queue.
LifoQueue: This is a LIFO (last in, first out) queue, also known as a stack.
PriorityQueue: This is a priority queue where entries are kept sorted and the lowest valued entry is retrieved first.
